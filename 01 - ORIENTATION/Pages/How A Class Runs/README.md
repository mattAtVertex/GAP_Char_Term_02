</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let's get started.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1>Required Lecture Viewing</h1>
<p>Required lectures are an important part of the curriculum here at Vertex School. If a module contains a required lecture, then . Let's break down how these work:</p>
<ul>
<li>The required lectures are your primary educational content for the module.</li>
<li>These are pre-recorded lectures that you can watch on demand.</li>
<li>Usually 45 minutes to an hour long.</li>
<li>Content is associated with the workshop topic of the week</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two reasons why we do it this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have the content on demand and aren't waiting around for a live session recording to finish uploading</li>
<li>Separating the lecture into its own video means&nbsp;live sessions can be more about instructor to student interaction and feedback.</li>
</ol>
<h1>How A Class Runs</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The way we run classes here at vertex is a little different. This difference is one of the core features of your experience here and part of what allows us to accelerate learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">First off, the class starts like a normal workday. Be on time or have made arrangements with a mentor to that they know the time that you’re able to come in in case there’s some work or family obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We recommend students to studios all the time and your attendance and your ability to be present in a class will be one of the major factors in our ability to recommend you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">At the beginning of each class it will be a very simple <strong>Call and Response</strong>. The teacher will ask if you can hear him or her and see his or her screen. Your job is to reply with a simple Yes or No. Nothing else. No maybes. No “I see it “. Simply Yes or No.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The teacher will then introduce some news that might be important or an administrative event that’s relevant to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Then one of two things happens. The mentor will either enter into <strong>Critique mode</strong> or they will enter into <strong>Teach mode</strong>. This can get switched up based on student preferences and the content the teacher has to go over.</span></p>
<h1>Critique Mode</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Critique&nbsp;mode</strong> is built around Hiring Triggers. As mentioned before, Hiring Triggers form the foundation of what we do at Vertex and they are the key to how we help you become a Job Candidate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Every Critique session focuses on specific criteria. For example, when you come to the High Polygon Modeling we are going to look at the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Topology</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bevels</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Proportion</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Edges</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our goal is to help you make sure that your high polygon model will pass the test with anybody and look like it’s created by a pro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">At the end of your critique the <strong>Mentor</strong> will give you one specific task that you need to achieve to move forward. We spent a lot of time thinking about what this one thing might be so please make sure to take this seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">While there are a lot of different things that you have to handle and that you have to address as a 3-D artist the only way to move forward is one step at a time. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is easy to be overwhelmed by the complexity of what we do and our job is to help you break that down into smaller and achievable chunks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When everybody has been given their <strong>One Thing</strong> to do in their work the Mentor will ask via the same Call &amp; Response method as the beginning of class, "Does everybody knows what they need to work on?" </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Your job is the answer yes or no. Not maybe. I repeat not a maybe. Maybe equals no.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We will always take the time to help you get clarity on what your one thing is our number one job. <em>The critique is nearly 4 times more important than any learning that we present to you later.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Remember the most important thing we do here is critique and help you move one step forward. You are not tourists here. You are active participants in creating your future and we are here to help guide you.</span></p>
<h1>Teach Mode</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">During a teaching section the teacher will demonstrate in software a specific workflow, feature, or concept. Our goal when we teach is to provide you with one main action such as creating a tileable brick pattern in substance designer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To do that we will often break these learning tasks down into 3 to 5 components that we need to teach you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For example, with a tileable brick patterns in substance designer we may focus you on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pattern</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Edging</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Grout</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Roughness</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">At the end of a learning section, the Mentor will ask you how clear you are on this content on a scale of 1 to 5. You’ll type your number in chat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Note, you do not have to be clear. The content may not even be relevant for what is most important for you. So please be straightforward and direct and let the mentor know so that they can adjust their content or if this is crucial to your capstone they can make sure they provide additional resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As a reminder, one of our guiding principles is that most people are over educated and under worked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our focus will be 100% on your work and the specific thing that is going to help you get a job. So the work that the mentor assigns to you may not relate to the learning content of that day. This is by design. Soak it up. Enjoy the new information. But remain hyper focused on the one thing you need to do to progress in your work.</span></p>
